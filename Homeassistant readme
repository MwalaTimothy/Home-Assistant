## Platform Requirements

- **Browser:** Google Chrome (Desktop) for Web Serial support
- **Hardware:** ESP32, ESP32-S3, C3-Mini, D1-Mini, or Raspberry Pi Pico W
- **Connection:** USB Triple Adapter or standard USB cable

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Flash Firmware
- Open the Solution Builder in Chrome
- Connect your device via USB
- Select the appropriate solution template
- Click "Install Firmware" and wait for completion

### 2. Device Setup

- Use consistent labels: `climate`, `security`, `energy`
- Enable automatic firmware updates
- Group related sensors on dashboard cards

## Simple Workflow

```
Device Assembly → Chrome Browser → Flash Firmware → Reset Device → 
WiFi Setup → Home Assistant Discovery → Configure & Use
```
